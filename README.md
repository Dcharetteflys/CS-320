How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
When trying to make sure that your code is fucntional and secure can be overwwhelming to say the least. Performing tests on code is something I have only done in this class, I have not performed any prior to this. I was something that I struggled with throughout this course. I was not not aware on how much work went into testing software. Th ebest way that i found to make my code functional and secure was by staying with in the requirements ans writing out extensive tests to try and provide the best possible coverage that I could when testing the code. I think i was able to provide a good coverage overall. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To best intperet the users needs the first thing I performed was reading what they are looking for and then I broke it down into manageble sections. THis was usedul because i think sometimes the client has a hard time trying to convey what they are looking for. Something that can to mind was the name in the code. They wanted to stay with in a certain charactor length and same with the description. I was able to break this down to make sure that it got the proper naming and there was a check for each of the items to make sure that nothing longer could be entered. 

How do I approach designing software?
I tend to read over the requirements of the software multiple times and take notes on the side of certain items. THis will help me break it down in to smaller items instead of trying to think about it as a whole. This helps prevent me from getting overwhelmed and not knowign where to start. Then I break into a list of objects needed to accomplish this and then do the same for the methods needed. AFter everything is started and there is a certain amount of code written then i go over what i had completed and make sure nothing is going to cause any errors. I do this multiple times when through out the process.
